				<div class="description-text">
					<p>The Campaign for Fiscal Equity (CFE) lawsuit was brought against the state of New York by New York City parents claiming the state underfunded the city’s public schools and therefore denied its students their constitutional right to a “sound basic education.”  In a landmark 2007 decision, the state's highest court made explicit the state’s constitutional obligation to provide <a class="clickable" title="CFE funding was tied to effective classroom reform strategies through the Contract for Excellence which prioritized pre-kindergarten, class-size reduction, middle and high school reform, programs for English language learners, effective teaching, and more time on task (longer school days or school years, tutoring, etc.)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"> essential resources</a> to all public school children and found that New York State is not providing the funding necessary to fulfill this constitutional obligation.</p>

					<p>For two years the state met its obligations, resulting in effective reforms in classrooms around the state. However, in 2009, as a result of the fiscal crisis, school aid was frozen.  Then, over the following two years, the state enacted over $2.7 billion in cuts, including over $2.1 billion in classroom cuts, in effect reversing CFE.</p>

					<p>The past few years have been incredibly difficult for our public schools.  Devastating cuts and inadequate state budgets have taken vital programs and services away from our students.  It is the state’s constitutional obligation to educate every student, and it's time that the State renews its commitment to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity before another generation of students graduates without having access to the resources they need to prepare them for college, careers, and life.  </p>

					<p>This web application provides information on CFE money owed to schools and districts in New York State.  It takes data shared by <a href="http://www.aqeny.org/" alt="aqe-site" target="_blank">Alliance for Quality Education</a> (AQE) and presents it in an easily searchable and shareable way to help relevant stakeholders educate and mobilize. </p>

					<p>For raw data, AQE used <a href="http://www.nysed.gov/" alt="nysed-site" target="_blank">NYS Education Department</a> data as published after the 2014-15 enacted budget was passed. The SED data files include the amount that school districts would receive if the Foundation Aid was fully phased as it was intended when it was passed in 2007. In addition, the School Aid 2014-15 file also shows how much Gap Elimination Adjustment is left for each school district.  A <a href="http://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php" target="_blank">separate database published by SED for the School Report Cards for 2012-13</a> lists all the schools and includes enrollment for each school in each district. Schools opened and changes in enrollment since this database was published are not included.</p> 

					<p>To calculate the amount owed per pupil, AQE divided the total amount owed to each school district by the total amount enrolled in the district (the sum of students in each school). They then calculated the amount owed to each school by the number of students in that school.</p> 

					<p>The actual distribution by school may vary depending on whether funding is provided as foundation aid, whether the Contract for Excellence rules apply, whether New York City uses its Fair Student Funding Formula and other factors. There is no way for anyone to calculate in advance the intersection of those formulae and rules. The methodology in <a href="http://www.aqeny.org/" alt="aqe-site" target="_blank">AQE's report</a> provides a fair and reasonable estimation of distribution based upon student enrollment data.</p>

					<p>To calculate the amount owed per Senate and Assembly district, AQE summed the total amount per school in each legislative district. AQE received the database that shows the schools and districts in each legislative district by the State Education Department.</p>
